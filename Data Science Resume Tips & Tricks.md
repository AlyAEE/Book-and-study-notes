# Data Science Resume Tips & Tricks

# Top 6 Resume Mistakes

## Mistake No.1: Detail Overload

Recruiters & Hiring Managers are notoriously fast at skimming Resumes and making quick decisions about which candidates to move through to the interview stage.

You MUST make it easy for them to quickly know you’re a) a match for the role, and to b) see your value

- Max 2 pages
- Remove or truncate detailed work experience that isn't relevant to the role
- Remove skills & tools that aren't relevant to the role
- Remove filler words and phrases like "hard-working" and "team player"

Less is more!

## Mistake No.2: Missing The Target

If you're interviewing for a Data Science role, you want to be consistently punching the reader in the face with "Data Science! Data Science! Data Science!" right from the top.

If you're transitioning over from another industry, this is even more important.

- Put in a headline under your name that mentions "Data Science", "Data Analysis" and/or "Machine Learning"
- Move your Data Science projects above your work experience if it's more relevant to the role

## Mistake No.3: Not Showing your “Motivation”

You’re being hired to *solve problems and add value* not to just know Python or Tensorflow.

Asserting this at the top of your Resume will put you ahead of 95% of candidates who just shout about the tools & skills they know.

It may not seem like much, but a hiring manager will love you if they read you are motivated by the following:

*"I am passionate about solving business problems using Data Science & Machine Learning.  I systematically & creatively use my skillset to add tangible value to the team, the business, and the end-user.  I am constantly learning, and always looking to improve."*

## Mistake No.4: Actions Only…

For each project (from past work experience, or from your portfolio) you need to include 3 key bits of information:

1. **What was the reason for the project or piece of work?**
2. **What did you do to solve it?**
3. **What was the result or impact**

One sentence for each of the above will showcase you as a holistic thinker who doesn't just "do stuff" - you understand business problems, you solve them, and you know the impact the work had (even more bonus points if you can include tangible values for the impact)

Trust me, most candidates just focus on the “what I did” part of each project, and they don’t give the context on the other two - so again, it’s a simple way to stand out above the competition

## Mistake No.5: Understanding Courses & Certificates

Certain influencers will tell you to leave courses & certifications off altogether as “they hold no value”

There is *some* truth to that, a shiny piece of paper doesn’t prove what you can or can’t do.

**BUT...**

There is also a great deal of value you miss out on providing to sell yourself to them.

The trick is simple.

Pick a maximum of 3 certificates or courses, and under each, list the *actionable learnings* that you got from it.

As an example, instead of just listing the course:

- **Natural Language Processing 101 - Udemy**

Do this instead:

- **Natural Language Processing 101 - Udemy**
    - *Actionable Learnings: Sentiment Analysis on customer reviews. This could be utilized to flag up customer complaints to a dedicated support team, improving customer satisfaction*

## Mistake No.6: The Little Things

A key skill in Data Science is being "detail-oriented" - so no matter your ability with Python or Tableau, grammatical & spelling mistakes on your Resume can damage your chances!

Review your Resume several times - and then get a friend or mentor to do the same.

**A fresh pair of eyes almost always find things you've missed!**

This is especially true if you're not confident with your English, or if it's not your first language.

**Keep consistent with fonts, sizes, formatting, and spacing.**

It doesn't seem like much, but take the time to get it right.  If you're sloppy with these little things, how can I know you'll take pride in your work?

How can I know that you'll keep your code & documentation tidy and organized?

Long story short -

**don't give the reader any reason to stop you from moving to the next stage**

of the interview process!
